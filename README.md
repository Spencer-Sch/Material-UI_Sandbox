# Sandbox practice for React and Material-UI

## Current Goal:

- Working to replicate layout of my previous Calculator project using Material-UI components

- Replication more or less finished
  - Struggling to get a couple spacing issues figured out
  - I intend to import a digital looking font for the two output areas
